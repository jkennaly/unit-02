# Treehouse Techdegree unit-02

This script assumes an html document containing a body with a .page
  div. The div contains a list of students as li elements in a ul element.
  This script will initially display the first ten names in the list and 
  hide the others. The script then creates a .pagination div below
  the .page div, that contains a nav bar to navigate amongst the pages.
  Clicking on an element in the nav bar will display the respective ten
  students (though the last page will be fewer if the number of students 
  is not a multiple of ten). There is also a search bar that will filter
  by the names and emails of each student, then the results will be 
  paginated. There is also a Search button, but it has no actual function
  and is present as a visual cue.
